```python
tensoring_resizing(data)
```

Applies a series of transformations to the 'image' column of a pandas DataFrame.

The transformations include converting images to PIL format, resizing them to 28x28 pixels,
and converting them to tensors. The transformed images are then permuted and converted back
to numpy arrays.

Args:
    data (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing an 'image' column with image data.

Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: The input DataFrame with the 'image' column transformed.
