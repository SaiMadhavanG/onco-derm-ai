Finetunes a pre-trained model on the given training dataset.
Args:
    train_dataset (DermaMNISTDataset): The dataset to train the model on.
    model_name (str): The name of the model to finetune.
    num_epochs (int): The number of epochs to train the model for.
    batch_size (int): The batch size to use during training.
    device (str): The device to train the model on (e.g., "cpu" or "cuda").
    lr (float): The learning rate for the optimizer.
Returns:
    dict: The state dictionary of the finetuned model.
