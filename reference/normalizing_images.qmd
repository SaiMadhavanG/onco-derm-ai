```python
normalizing_images(data)
```

Normalizes the pixel values of images in the given DataFrame.

This function takes a DataFrame containing image data and normalizes the pixel values
by dividing each pixel value by 255.0. The normalized pixel values will be in the range [0, 1].

Args:
    data (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing image data. The DataFrame must have a column
        named "image" where each entry is an image represented as a numerical array.

Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with the same structure as the input, but with normalized image pixel values.
