# Project Proposal

### Executive Summary

We propose developing a machine learning-based skin cancer screening system utilizing dermatoscopic images. The system will assist medical professionals in preliminary skin lesion assessment while incorporating robust MLOps practices and responsible AI principles.

### Problem Statement

Skin cancer diagnosis requires expert dermatological knowledge and careful image analysis. While machine learning can assist in this process, deploying such systems in clinical settings requires careful consideration of reliability, explainability, and operational excellence.

### Dataset

- **Source**: DermaMNIST (based on HAM10000)
- **Classes**: 7 distinct skin lesion categories:
  1. Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma (akiec)
  2. Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
  3. Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)
  4. Dermatofibroma (df)
  5. Melanoma (mel)
  6. Melanocytic nevi (nv)
  7. Vascular lesions (vasc)
- **Characteristics**:
  - 28x28 pixel dermatoscopic images
  - 10,015 training images
  - 1,268 validation images
  - 2,239 test images
- **Data Split**: Predefined splits provided by MedMNIST

### Technical Architecture

#### 1. Model Development

- **Base Architecture**:
  - ResNet-18 or MobileNetV2 (modified for 28x28 input)
  - Consideration for lightweight models due to smaller input size
- **Training Pipeline**:
  - Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, color jittering)
  - Transfer learning with ImageNet weights
  - Fine-tuning strategies for small image sizes
  - Cross-validation for robust performance estimation

#### 2. MLOps Infrastructure

- **Data Pipeline**:
  - Data ingestion and preprocessing
  - Data versioning
  - Data quality checks
- **Experiment Tracking**:
  - MLflow for model versioning and tracking
  - Hyperparameter optimization
  - Model performance visualization
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automated testing (unit, integration, model performance)
  - Automated model deployment
  - Automated documentation generation
- **Monitoring**:
  - Model performance metrics
  - Data drift detection
  - Automatic retraining triggers

#### 3. Production Features

##### Model Robustness & Reliability

- **Explainability**:
- **Confidence Calibration**:

- **Adversarial Robustness**:
- **Out-of-Distribution Detection**:

##### Clinical Integration

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Real-time inference results
  - Confidence scores and explanations
  - Image preprocessing and quality checks
  - Resolution handling and upscaling options
- **Conformal Predictions**:
  - Set-valued predictions with guaranteed coverage
  - Calibrated confidence scores

##### Data Privacy & Compliance

- **Right to Erasure**:
  - Automated removal pipeline

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Technical Metrics

- Model accuracy
- Precision, recall, F1-score per class
- Inference latency
- Data drift metrics

#### Clinical Metrics

- False positive/negative rates
- Calibration error
- OOD detection accuracy
- Explanation quality (user feedback)

### Challenges & Risks

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Limited resolution impact on performance
   - Model bias
   - System scalability
   - Integration challenges
2. **Clinical Risks**:
   - Over-reliance on system
   - Misinterpretation of results
   - Edge case handling
   - Resolution limitations affecting diagnosis

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Clear Disclaimer**: System is for screening assistance only
2. **Resolution Warning**: Clear indication of image resolution limitations
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Usage guidelines and limitations
4. **Regular Updates**: Continuous model improvement
5. **User Training**: Proper system usage and interpretation

### Future Enhancements

1. VQA chatbot for assisting medical professionals
2. Extension to other dermoscopic datasets
